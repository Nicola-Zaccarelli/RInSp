Description: Functions to calculate several ecological indices of individual and population niche width
   (Araujo's E, clustering and pairwise similarity among individuals, IS, Petraitis' W, and Roughgarden's
   WIC/TNW) to assess individual specialization based on data of resource use. Resource use can be
   quantified by counts of categories, measures of mass/lenght or proportions. Monte Carlo resampling
   procedures are available for hypothesis testing against multinomial null models.
